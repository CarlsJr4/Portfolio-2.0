This portfolio was built with GatsbyJS combined with Sanity.io to deliver a high-performance portfolio website that is extremely easy to maintain. Using the Gatsby Node API, data can be edited in a headless CMS, retrieved, and then translated into project pages as soon as the website loads. It's a lot less work than updating the portfolio by hand.
